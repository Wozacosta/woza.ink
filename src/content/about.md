# Hey, I'm Samy

I'm a developer who loves building things on the web. This site is my corner of the internet where I share projects, thoughts, and experiments.

## What I Do

By day, I work as a software engineer, crafting products that (hopefully) make people's lives a little easier. By night, I tinker with side projects, explore new technologies, and occasionally write about what I learn.

I'm particularly interested in:

- **Web development** — React, Next.js, and the ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem
- **Developer tools** — Making the development experience smoother
- **Creative coding** — Generative art, interactive experiences, and visual experiments

## Why woza.ink?

"Woza" means "come" in Zulu — an invitation. This site is an invitation to explore, learn, and build together.

The `.ink` domain felt right for a space dedicated to writing code and sharing ideas. Every project starts as an idea, scribbled somewhere, before it becomes real.

## The Philosophy

I believe in:

- **Learning in public** — Sharing what I learn, even when it's messy
- **Building for fun** — Not everything needs to be monetized
- **Shipping over perfecting** — Done is better than perfect
- **Simple over clever** — Code that's easy to understand beats code that's impressive
