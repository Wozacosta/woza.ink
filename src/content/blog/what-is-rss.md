# What is RSS? A Guide to Taking Back Control of Your Content

Remember when you could visit your favorite websites and actually see everything they published? Before algorithms decided what was "relevant" to you?

RSS brings that back.

## What is RSS?

RSS stands for **Really Simple Syndication**. It's a standardized format that websites use to publish updates. When a site has an RSS feed, it's essentially saying: "Here's a machine-readable list of everything we've published."

Think of it like a subscription that actually works. No algorithmic filtering. No ads injected into your timeline. Just the content you asked for, in the order it was published.

## How Does It Work?

1. A website publishes content (articles, podcasts, videos)
2. The site generates an RSS feed (an XML file listing recent content)
3. You subscribe to that feed using an RSS reader
4. Your reader checks the feed periodically and shows you new items

That's it. No account required on the publisher's end. No tracking. No engagement metrics deciding what you see.

## Why Should You Care?

### You Control the Algorithm

Social media platforms optimize for engagement, which often means outrage and controversy. RSS feeds just show you things in chronological order. Revolutionary, I know.

### No FOMO

When you follow someone on social media, you might see 10% of what they post. With RSS, you see everything. If a blogger posts once a month, you won't miss it buried under a flood of other content.

### Privacy

RSS readers fetch content anonymously. The publisher doesn't know who you are, how long you spent reading, or whether you clicked on anything. You're just... reading.

### It Works Everywhere

RSS has been around since 1999. It's supported by thousands of apps across every platform. If one reader shuts down, you can export your subscriptions and move to another.

## Getting Started

### 1. Pick a Reader

Here are some solid options:

- **NetNewsWire** (Mac/iOS) - Free, open source, beautiful
- **Feedly** (Web/Mobile) - Popular, free tier available
- **Inoreader** (Web/Mobile) - Powerful filtering options
- **Miniflux** (Self-hosted) - For the privacy-conscious

### 2. Find Feeds

Many websites have RSS feeds even if they don't advertise them. Look for:

- An RSS icon (that orange square with radio waves)
- Links in the footer saying "RSS" or "Feed"
- Add `/feed`, `/rss`, or `/feed.xml` to the site URL

For this blog, the feed is at [/feed.xml](/feed.xml).

### 3. Subscribe

Copy the feed URL and paste it into your reader. Done.

## What Can You Follow?

Almost anything:

- **Blogs** - Most have RSS built in
- **News sites** - Major outlets all have feeds
- **Podcasts** - Every podcast is distributed via RSS
- **YouTube channels** - Every channel has a hidden RSS feed
- **Reddit** - Add `.rss` to any subreddit URL
- **GitHub** - Follow releases, commits, issues

## The RSS Renaissance

RSS never died, but it did fall out of the mainstream when Google killed Reader in 2013. Now, as people grow tired of algorithmic feeds and walled gardens, RSS is experiencing a quiet comeback.

It's not flashy. It doesn't have features that create "engagement." It just works, exactly as it should, putting you in control of what you read.

And that's pretty radical in 2026.
