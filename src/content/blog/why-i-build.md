# Why I Build Things

There's a question I get asked a lot: "Why do you spend your free time building side projects?"

It's a fair question. After a full day of coding at work, the last thing most people want to do is... more coding. But for me, side projects serve a different purpose than work.

## Work vs. Play

At work, I'm solving other people's problems. The constraints are set by business requirements, legacy code, and team decisions made years ago. It's valuable work, but it's not *my* work.

Side projects are different. They're playgrounds where I can:

- Try new technologies without risk
- Build exactly what I want, how I want
- Ship something in a weekend instead of a quarter

## The Compound Effect

Each project I build teaches me something. Pomo taught me about state management patterns. Wezer taught me about working with weather APIs. FitLog taught me about data visualization.

These lessons compound. The more I build, the faster I can build the next thing. The patterns become intuitive. The debugging becomes quicker.

## Staying Sharp

The tech industry moves fast. If you're not learning, you're falling behind. Side projects are my way of staying current without it feeling like homework.

When I want to learn a new framework, I don't read the docs and call it a day. I build something with it. That's when the real learning happens.

## The Joy of Shipping

There's something deeply satisfying about taking an idea from your head and putting it on the internet for anyone to use. It doesn't matter if 10 people use it or 10,000. The act of shipping is the reward.

## It's Not About the Money

None of my side projects make money. That's intentional. The moment I start thinking about monetization, the fun disappears. These projects are for me, and if others find them useful, that's a bonus.
